Do I have to pay the full amount upfront?\r\nNo. We work on a milestone-based prepaid system. Each milestone is discussed and paid before that phase begins.\r\n\r\n4. How do you handle revisions?\r\nEach milestone includes 2 free revisions. Additional revisions may be billed separately depending on complexity.\r\n\r\n5. What if I need to add a feature mid-project?\r\nYou’ll need to fill a Feature Addition Form. We will assess the task, provide a quote and update the delivery timeline accordingly.\r\n\r\n6. What if I want to change the task priority or sequence?\r\nYou can submit a Reschedule Request Form. It may not increase the cost but will likely extend the timeline depending on availability.\r\n\r\n7. Do you support phone calls?\r\nWe don’t provide phone support.

What’s your refund policy?\r\nFor new clients:\r\nIf no meaningful work is completed within 7 days of payment, we offer a 100% refund. Once work begins, milestone payments are non-refundable.\r\n\r\n10. What happens if I delay feedback?\r\nYou’re expected to respond within 3 days after submission of deliverables. From the 4th day onward, your delay will extend the deadline accordingly.\r\n\r\n11. Do you offer consultations?\r\nFirst pre-project consultation is free (up to 30 minutes)\r\n\r\nAdditional consultations before project confirmation are $49 per session\r\n\r\nUrgent meetings during an ongoing project (outside regular check-ins) are also $49 per session\r\n\r\n12. Who owns the code?\r\nYou own 100% of the code after full payment. We request footer credits if allowed and may use the project in our portfolio unless an NDA is signed.\r\n\r\n13. How long are quotes valid?\r\nAll quotes are valid for 7 days. Post that, scope and pricing may change based on availability or updated requirements.",
